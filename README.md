# OpenAI Realtime Console - Next.js

## Change list
- Components are broken down for clarity
- Switched to yarn.
- Integrated with Next.js 14+
- Code is still spaghetti, but at least now it comes with meatballs.


## How to?
```
yarn relay # To start the relay at localhost:8001
yarn start # To start the client at localhost:3000
```
